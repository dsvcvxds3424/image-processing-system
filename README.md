# image-processing-system

To solve this assignment, we need to build a system that efficiently processes image data from CSV files. The system will accept a CSV file, validate its format, asynchronously process the images (compressing them by 50%), store the processed images and associated product information in a database, and provide APIs for users to check the processing status. Below is a step-by-step guide to solving this assignment.
